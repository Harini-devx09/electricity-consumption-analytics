# ⚡ Plugging into the Future: An Exploration of Electricity Consumption Patterns Using Tableau

## 📌 Project Overview

**Plugging into the Future** is a final-year data analytics project that explores electricity consumption patterns across India using **Tableau**, **SQL**, and a **Flask-based web application**.  
The project transforms large-scale electricity consumption data into interactive dashboards and stories to uncover meaningful trends related to time, region, and sector.

The insights generated through this project can help utility companies, policymakers, researchers, and consumers make informed decisions for efficient energy usage and sustainable power management.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Electricity consumption data in India is vast and complex, and is often presented through static reports that are difficult to interpret and analyze.  
Existing systems suffer from:

- Limited interactivity  
- Poor regional and sector-wise insights  
- Difficulty in identifying trends and peak demand  
- Lack of an integrated web-based visualization platform  

There is a need for an **interactive, analytical, and user-friendly system** that enables clear exploration of electricity consumption patterns.

## ✅ Project Objectives

- Analyze electricity consumption trends across **states, regions, and sectors**
- Identify **peak demand periods** and **low-demand intervals**
- Study **seasonal variations** and year-wise consumption
- Compare **pre-lockdown and post-lockdown electricity usage**
- Build interactive **Tableau dashboards and stories**
- Publish visualizations on **Tableau Public**
- Embed dashboards into a **Flask-based web application**

## 📊 Key Analysis Scenarios

### 🔹 Scenario 1: Time-of-Day Usage Patterns
Analyzes electricity consumption across different times of the day to identify peak and off-peak usage periods, supporting demand management and energy optimization.

### 🔹 Scenario 2: Seasonal Variations and Forecasting
Examines how electricity consumption varies across months and seasons, helping stakeholders plan for seasonal demand fluctuations.

### 🔹 Scenario 3: Sector-Specific Consumption Insights
Explores electricity usage patterns across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors to identify major consumers and improve energy efficiency initiatives.
